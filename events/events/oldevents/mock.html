		<header> MOCK MODULE SESSION (MMS) on SUBSTANCE ABUSE </header>
		<article>
			<p>Uddeshyaâ€™s main aim is empowering youth by spreading awareness. Through all our modules we aim to spread our thoughts and views and make people aware of what lies ahead of them if they chose a certain path. We do not enforce our views on them but instead open a variety of choices for them.  One of the modules on Substance Abuse was recently presented. Any drug being consumed in high quantities or for a prolonged period of time or both becomes and abuse and a person becomes dependent on it. We are at the peak of our emotional instability at this age. Due to factors like peer pressure, depression, excitement etc. we tend to fall into substance abuse. This can lead to a wide array of criminal activities and anti-social behavior sometimes with long term personality changes in the individual.  We as peer educators spread awareness and list out the side effects and how to cope up with such circumstances. We make you realize what really matters and even if you do get addicted to it, it is not the end of the world. The session that was held was a very interactive session. There were a lot of valuable inputs put forward by the senior members and the audience was very supportive.</p>
