		<article>
			<p>The second instalment of the Election hour was conducted on 12th March,2014 and the topic of discussion was &ldquo;populist propaganda- Effective Governance vs. False Pretext&rdquo;.
			<p>The Event was moderated by Mr. Siddharth Sinha and it was presided by the faculty members of VIT University, Dr. Brijesh Nair and Dr. Joshua. The major cause of concern and the crux of the discussion revolved around the mentality of the Indians and how most of them cast their votes based on who distributes the maximum number of freebies.
			<p>The inability of the citizens to think about the long term and being content with immediate advantages was the central theme of the discussion.
			<p>It was finally concluded on the note that we the citizens of India should stay away from the Populist propaganda and cast our votes sensibly. We should weigh our options and make our choices based on long term aspects which will eventually lead to the progress of our country.
